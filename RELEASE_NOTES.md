## v1.8.5 (2026-07-20) — the two fixes v1.8.4 announced now actually work

Four adversarial reviews of v1.8.4 found that both of its headline fixes were
incomplete in ways the release notes did not reflect. This release makes them
real. If you are on 1.8.4, this is the one to take.

### Fixed — a failure that was *returned* was still audited as a success

vmware-policy 1.8.4 added `report_tool_failure()` for tools that catch an
exception and return an error payload instead of raising. **No skill called it.**

Every string-returning tool therefore kept doing exactly what 1.8.4 said it had
stopped doing: writing `status=ok` to `~/.vmware/audit.db` for an operation that
failed, recording an undo token for a change that never happened, and telling the
circuit breaker the call succeeded so repeated failures never tripped it.

The surface this covered is not marginal:

| Skill | What was mis-audited |
|---|---|
| vmware-aiops | 25 of 49 tools, including **every undo-bearing write** — a failed `vm_power_on` left an undo token saying "power it back off" |
| vmware-avi | all 28 tools, including `vs_toggle` and `ako_restart` |
| vmware-storage | all 4 write tools |
| vmware-nsx | the 5 delete tools |

vmware-avi is worth calling out: before 1.8.4 its exceptions propagated and the
audit was correct. 1.8.4 caught them and returned a string, so **that release made
its audit trail worse than it had been.**

Skills whose tools already return dict payloads (vmware-monitor, vmware-vks,
vmware-aria, vmware-log-insight, vmware-harden, vmware-debug, vmware-pilot) were
already detected correctly. They gained a test proving it rather than a redundant
call.

### Fixed — narrowing `OSError` did not close the leak it was meant to close

1.8.4 narrowed the `_safe_error` passthrough because bare `OSError` let TLS and
DNS failures reach the agent with hostnames and certificate subjects in them.
That narrowing had no effect on the error it was written for:

```
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError → ssl.SSLError → OSError, ValueError
```

`ValueError` has been on every allowlist since long before 1.8.4, so a
certificate failure kept passing through — the commonest self-signed-certificate
failure in this family, carrying the hostname it was checked against. An
allowlist structurally cannot express "not this one".

Where `ssl.SSLError` can actually surface — the pyVmomi skills — it is now
reduced *ahead* of the allowlist. In the httpx skills TLS arrives wrapped as
`httpx.ConnectError`, and in vmware-avi as `requests.exceptions.SSLError`, so the
guard cannot fire there; in those skills the leak was the raw exception
interpolated into an already-allowlisted `*ApiError`, and that is now authored
text naming the config target and `verify_ssl` instead of the exception.

The missing-password error — this family's most common first-run failure, whose
entire remedy is the environment variable name it carries — keeps its message
through a narrow `ConfigError(OSError)` rather than the base class. Connection
failures are translated at the connection layer into an authored remedy that
names the target and the setting to change, with the raw detail left on
`__cause__` for the server log.

### Also fixed

- **vmware-vks**: the quickstart documented a password variable the code never
  reads — following `README.md` verbatim produced "Password not found". Five
  places, plus six references to a `doctor` command this CLI has never had, two
  descriptions promising fields the tools do not return, and eight teaching
  messages that `RuntimeError` was masking.
- **vmware-nsx**: an error cited `--route-advertisement`; the flag is `--advertise`.
- **vmware-pilot**: `get_workflow_status` told the model to call `approve` — a
  tool the read-only gate withholds — as the required next step; and a hint
  pointed at a filename that could never appear in that message.
- **vmware-aiops**: `vm_task_status` polling a *failed task* returned
  `{"state": "error", "error": ...}` from a successful read, which the new
  detection read as the call itself failing. The field is now `task_error`.
  **This is a breaking change for anything parsing that payload.**
- Several remedies that were still being cut by the 300-character cap the 1.8.4
  notes claimed to have addressed.

### Known and not fixed

`ConnectionError` remains one type from two sources in several skills — a
skill's own authored message and urllib3's `HTTPSConnectionPool(host=..., port=...)`
share it, and an allowlist cannot separate them. vmware-vks is converted; the
rest need their own domain type and are deferred rather than half-done.

## v1.8.4 (2026-07-20) — errors that teach, and tool descriptions a small model can route from

A capability eval was rolled out across the family and asked two open questions:
when a call fails, is the model told enough to fix it, and can it pick the right
tool from the description alone? Both answers were worse than anyone thought, and
in several places the reason was that the measurement was looking somewhere other
than where the model reads.

### Fixed — teaching messages were being discarded on the way to the agent

`_safe_error` reduces unrecognised exceptions to `"<Class>: operation failed."`
so raw API text, credentials in URLs and internal paths cannot reach an agent.
Its allowlist held only the builtin validation errors — so this skill's **own**
domain exceptions, the ones that exist precisely to carry a corrected next step,
had their messages replaced by their class names.

The effect was invisible from the CLI, which prints those messages in full.

The worst case was shared by nine skills: `config.py` raises exactly one
`OSError`, the missing-password error, whose entire remedy is the environment
variable name it names. An agent hitting an unconfigured target received
`OSError: operation failed.` and had nothing to act on. That is the family's most
common first-run failure, and it landed one release after the documented variable
names were corrected — so the message that would have unstuck the operator was
the one being thrown away.

The rule is now the property it always meant: **every exception this skill raises
on purpose passes through**, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced.
`RuntimeError` stays reduced — it is the generic catch-all and in several skills
carries raw upstream text.

### Fixed — error messages now carry the correction

Every message that reported a failure without saying how to recover was
rewritten: it names the offending value, gives an imperative remedy, and names
something concrete to act on — a tool that exists, a real CLI command, a config
file, an environment variable. Recovery becomes an instruction-following problem
rather than an inference one, which is what a weak model can still do.

Three classes of defect surfaced while doing it:

- **Remedies that were never delivered.** `_safe_error` truncates with no
  ellipsis, so a message longer than the cap loses its closing sentence
  silently. One message had been shipping at 396 characters against a 300-char
  cap — its remedy had never once reached an agent. Messages now lead with the
  remedy so a long interpolated value truncates the expendable detail instead.
- **Commands that do not exist.** One skill's error hints named a `doctor`
  subcommand it does not have.
- **Tools that do not exist.** A tool description pointed at two sibling-skill
  tools that had been renamed, and another named a tool that had moved to a
  different skill entirely.

### Improved — tool descriptions state when to use them and what to call next

The description is the API for a small model: an unstated routing rule is a
routing rule that does not exist, and a tool with no stated next hop is one the
model stops at. Descriptions now say when to prefer this tool over a sibling,
what shape comes back, the caveat that bites, and which tool to call after.

**Manifest size did not grow.** Descriptions load into every session, so the
routing clauses were paid for by cutting duplicated reference material —
repeated boilerplate, examples that restated the parameter list, and prose
copies of the pagination contract.

### Note

Every tool and CLI command named anywhere in this release was verified against
the live MCP registry and the live command tree, not against documentation.

## v1.8.3 (2026-07-20) — credentials resolve as a pair; documented env vars now exist

### Changed — version alignment

No functional change in this skill. The family release adds an env-var override for the per-target username in the credential-bearing skills; this package has no per-target credentials.

## v1.8.2 (2026-07-20) — the MCP server moves into the package namespace

### Fixed — co-installing two skills broke all but the last one

Every skill shipped its MCP server as a **top-level `mcp_server` package**. Python
has one top-level namespace, so installing any two of them into one environment let
the second overwrite the first — silently, with no error and no warning.

    uv tool install vmware-aiops   ->  49 tools   (correct)
    uv pip  install vmware-aiops   ->  27 tools   (Monitor's read-only server)

vmware-aiops depends on vmware-monitor, so this was not an edge case: **every pip
install hit it**, and the operator got 27 read-only tools where 49 were expected,
with all 35 write tools missing. Docker images, shared MCP hosts and CI runners that
install more than one skill were affected the same way.

The server now lives at `vmware_<skill>/mcp_server/`, a name only this package can
claim. Introduced 2026-02-26; it survived 70 releases because every test ran against
a single package in its own repo, where the local directory shadows site-packages —
the conflict was invisible by construction.

**Migration.** Console scripts are unchanged: `vmware-<skill>` and
`vmware-<skill>-mcp` work exactly as before, as does `"command": "vmware-<skill>",
"args": ["mcp"]` in an MCP client config. Only a direct `python -m mcp_server`
breaks; use `python -m vmware_<skill>.mcp_server`.

### Added — `references/agent-guardrails.md` in every skill

The operating rules for local and small models (Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen, Mistral via
Goose / Ollama / OpenShift AI) existed in two skills. They now ship in all 13, each
with its own tool counts and failure modes, and are linked from every SKILL.md.

### Changed — Python floor is 3.10 across the family

vmware-debug and vmware-log-insight demanded 3.11 on the grounds that FastMCP schema
reflection was unreliable on 3.10. That was the symptom of PEP 604 `X | None` in the
server's own signatures, fixed in 1.8.0. 3.10 was verified end to end on 2026-07-19 —
every tool's schema built, zero failures — so the stricter floor was rejecting a
version that works.

## v1.8.1 (2026-07-19) — read-only mode reaches the surfaces that teach it

v1.8.0 put read-only mode in the code and documented it in the README only.
Every other layer was empty, and each serves a different reader: SKILL.md is what
the agent loads, setup-guide is what an operator reads while configuring, `doctor`
is where they verify it took. The gap had two concrete costs.

An agent read SKILL.md, called a write tool the gate had withheld, and got nothing
back — with no way to learn that the absence was a deliberate lockdown rather than
a fault. It reads as a broken tool, so the model retries or hunts for a workaround.

An operator who set the switch had no way to confirm it. The only signal was a line
in the MCP server's start-up log.

### Added — the feature is now documented where each reader looks

SKILL.md, setup-guide and capabilities now cover read-only mode. Both tools here
are reads, so nothing is withheld — the gate instead verifies that at start-up
rather than taking this documentation's word for it. Env vars are the only switch;
this package has no config file.

## v1.8.0 (2026-07-18) — read-only mode, working policy defaults, declared environments

Family release driven by [VMware-AIops#31](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/issues/31),
where an operator running Llama 3.3 70B (Goose / OpenShift AI, on-prem H100) had to
hand-write 17 prompt guardrails to make tool calling reliable. A prompt is advisory — a
model can ignore it. Every guardrail that could move into the harness has.

### Added
- **Read-only mode.** Set `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` (or the per-skill
  `VMWARE_DEBUG_READ_ONLY`) and every write tool is removed from the MCP registry at
  start-up. `list_tools()` never offers them, so the model cannot call what it cannot
  see. **Off by default** — nothing changes unless you turn it on. Fail-closed: if the
  mode is requested but cannot be guaranteed, the server refuses to start rather than
  running open. **vmware-debug has no `config.yaml`, so the environment variables are the
  only switch** — precedence is per-skill env → family env → off. Both tools are `[READ]`,
  so the gate withholds nothing here; its empty result *is* the assertion.
- **`environment:` scoping for policy rules.** Policy rules now scope by the environment
  a target declares (production / staging / lab). Skills that connect to a VMware estate
  declare it per target in their own `config.yaml`; vmware-debug connects to nothing and
  has no config, so it reports a constant `local`.

### Added — list results now state whether they are complete

Every `[READ]` list tool returns the family envelope instead of a bare array:

    {"items": [...], "returned": 50, "limit": 50, "total": 213,
     "truncated": true, "hint": "Showing 50 of 213. Raise limit or narrow the query..."}

This closes the reported failure where long responses were summarised as "no data
returned": a bare list gives a model no way to tell a complete answer from page one, so
it guessed. `truncated: false` now positively states completeness — including when
`items` is empty, which means "checked, found none", not "the call failed".

- **1 tool(s) converted** across ops, MCP and CLI. The routing table is a fixed constant, so `total` is exact and `truncated` is always
  false — there is no page two to go looking for.

### Changed — migration, read this
- **Approval tiers now actually run.** They shipped in v1.6.0 but the engine only ever
  read `~/.vmware/rules.yaml`, and a fresh install has no such file — so every deny rule,
  maintenance window and approval tier had been inert on every install that never
  hand-authored one. A packaged baseline now loads when you have written no rules of your
  own. Writes at medium risk and above are stamped with their tier in the audit log;
  irreversible work and guest execution against a target declared `production` require a
  named approver via `VMWARE_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`.
- **`environment:` will become required for writes — but not here.** Across the family, a
  state-changing operation against a target that declares no `environment:` still runs and
  logs a warning, and **the next major release refuses it**. vmware-debug ships no tool
  above read risk, holds no credentials and makes no network calls, so there is nothing to
  migrate — it reports a constant `local` and the upgrade is a no-op for this package.
  Read-only operations are never affected, in this release or the next. Check what applies
  to your write-capable siblings before upgrading:
  `vmware-audit policy --operation vm_delete --env <env>`.

### Fixed
- **Policy glob patterns with a leading wildcard silently matched nothing.** A rule written
  `operations: ["*_delete"]` parsed fine, read correctly, and never fired — only a trailing
  `*` was honoured. Now full glob matching, for operations and environments alike.

### Notes
- Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.0`; publish that package first.
- `vmware-audit policy` reports which rules are in force and where they came from —
  including the case where your rules file exists but failed to parse, which previously
  looked identical to "policy is working".

## v1.6.1 (2026-06-24) — initial release

First release of **vmware-debug**: the read-only diagnostic brain of the VMware
skill family. You bring the symptom; it runs the investigation, correlates
events from the other skills into one timeline, ranks root-cause hypotheses, and
routes remediation to vmware-aiops / vmware-pilot. It never writes and never
executes fixes (advisor/executor split, mirroring vmware-harden → vmware-pilot).

### Added
- **2 read-only MCP tools**: `incident_timeline` (correlate pre-fetched events
  into a timeline + z-score spikes + ranked hypotheses + next-check ideas) and
  `list_symptom_categories` (the symptom→skill routing catalogue).
- **Unified event envelope** + tolerant normalizer so debug stays source-agnostic
  with zero runtime dependency on the other skill packages — the agent fans out
  to each skill's read tools and feeds events here (avoids cross-skill coupling,
  踩坑 #21/#32).
- **Pure correlation engine** (timeline merge, time-binning, spike detection,
  hypothesis ranking, symptom routing) — fully unit-tested offline.
- **Typer CLI**: `triage`, `categories`, `version`, `mcp`. The `mcp` entry point
  needs no network at startup (proxy-safe, 踩坑 #25).
- SKILL.md + references (event-envelope contract, symptom routing, playbooks).

### Notes
- Read-only by construction; remediation is routed, never executed.
- `parse_timestamp` rejects implausible/garbage timestamps loudly rather than
  silently landing at the epoch.
